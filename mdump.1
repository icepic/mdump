.Dt MDUMP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mdump
.Nd display malloc leak or debug data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdump
.Op Fl Dl
.Op Fl e Ar file
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the malloc trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human-readable format.
A typicla run of the program to produce the information is
.Pp
.Dl $ MALLOC_OPTIONS=DT ktrace -tu program
.Pp
By default, the file
.Pa ktrace.out
in the current directory is displayed, unless overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e Ar file
Specify the file to use for symbol lookup.
This can be used for statically linked executables,
where the trace information does not include the file being executed.
.It Fl D
Show the very detailed malloc internal information dump.
.It Fl f Ar file
Display the specified file instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
Specifying
.Sq -
will read from standard input.
.It Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Show output only for the
.Ar pid
specified.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ktrace.out -compact
.It Pa ktrace.out
default ktrace dump file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ktrace 1 ,
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh CAVEATS
To produce readable stack traces, the program and its libraries should be
compiled with debug information.
Statically linked programs must be compiled with the
.Fl nopie
option.
High optimization levels can produce debug information that
.Nm
cannot interpret.
.Pp
Setuid or setgid processes can only be traced by the superuser.
.Pp
Forking programs can be traced by using the
.Fl i
flag to
.Xr ktrace 1 ,
but selecting a single process is needed when running
.Nm
on the trace file generated.
